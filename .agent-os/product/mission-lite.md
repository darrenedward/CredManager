# Product Mission (Lite)

API Key Manager is a desktop security application that helps Linux developers and system administrators securely manage project credentials and API keys by providing customizable field templates, encrypted storage, and session-based security.

API Key Manager serves developers and system administrators who need centralized, secure credential management across multiple projects. Unlike generic password managers, API Key Manager provides dynamic field customization per project type, Go backend performance with Flutter cross-platform UI, and configurable session security with military-grade encryption for sensitive data.
