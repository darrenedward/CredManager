# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement complete biometric authentication functionality that allows users to unlock the API Key Manager using fingerprint, face recognition, or other biometric methods supported by their device. Users can enable biometric authentication through Settings by providing their passphrase and completing biometric enrollment, then use biometric verification to access their credentials without entering their master passphrase on subsequent application launches.
