# Spec Summary (Lite)

Overhaul authentication to resolve passcode rejection by fixing Argon2 parsing and adding input trimming, eliminate insecure SHA-256 fallback with Argon2-only enforcement, consolidate all storage to a passphrase-unlocked SQLCipher-encrypted database, derive all secrets dynamically from the passphrase, remove hardcoded values and mocks like predefined questions, and enhance biometrics with AES encryption to achieve military-grade security for the credential vault app.
