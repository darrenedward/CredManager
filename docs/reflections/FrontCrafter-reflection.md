# FrontCrafter Reflections

## 2025-09-11: Task PT001-ST002-IMPLEMENTATION
- [2025-09-11T09:16:58Z] Task PT001-ST002: Required context file 'docs/project-management/project-context.md' not found. Proceeding with available contexts under YOLO MVP mode. Potential impact: Limited understanding of broader project dependencies. Resolution: Rely on spec.md, tasks.md, test plan, and existing code analysis for implementation.
- [2025-09-12] PT005 ST032: Integrated migration UI prompts using AuthService.checkMigrationStatus() in login and setup screens. Learned that clear, non-technical messaging about security upgrades greatly improves user trust and reduces confusion during legacy data migration. UI logic must handle both passphrase and security question migrations, prompting for re-setup only when necessary.
